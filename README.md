A movie recommendation system using Surprise, a popular library for building recommender systems

It leverages the Surprise library to process user-movie rating data and build a recommendation model using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The model identifies underlying patterns in user preferences and movie characteristics. By analyzing these patterns, the system predicts ratings for unrated movies and recommends movies that a user might enjoy.
